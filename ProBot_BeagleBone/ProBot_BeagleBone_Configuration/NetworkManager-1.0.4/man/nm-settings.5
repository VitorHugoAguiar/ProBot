.SH "NAME"
nm-settings \- Description of settings and properties of NetworkManager connection profiles
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
NetworkManager is based on a concept of connection profiles, sometimes referred to as connections only\&. These connection profiles contain a network configuration\&. When NetworkManager activates a connection profile on a network device the configuration will be applied and an active network connection will be established\&. Users are free to create as many connection profiles as they see fit\&. Thus they are flexible in having various network configurations for different networking needs\&. The connection profiles are handled by NetworkManager via
\fIsettings service\fR
and are exported on D\-Bus (\fI/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Settings/<num>\fR
objects)\&. The conceptual objects can be described as follows:
.PP
Connection (profile)
.RS 4
A specific, encapsulated, independent group of settings describing all the configuration required to connect to a specific network\&. It is referred to by a unique identifier called the UUID\&. A connection is tied to a one specific device type, but not necessarily a specific hardware device\&. It is composed of one or more
\fISettings\fR
objects\&.
.RE
.PP
Setting
.RS 4
A group of related key/value pairs describing a specific piece of a
\fIConnection (profile)\fR\&. Settings keys and allowed values are described in the tables below\&. Keys are also reffered to as properties\&. Developers can find the setting objects and their properties in the libnm\-util sources\&. Look for the
\fBclass_init\fR
functions near the bottom of each setting source file\&.
.RE
.PP
The settings and properties shown in tables below list all available connection configuration options\&. However, note that not all settings are applicable to all connection types\&. NetworkManager provides a command\-line tool
\fInmcli\fR
that allows direct configuration of the settings and properties according to a connection profile type\&.
\fInmcli\fR
connection editor has also a built\-in
\fIdescribe\fR
command that can display description of particular settings and properties of this page\&.
