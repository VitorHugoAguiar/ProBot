How to configure the ProBot BeagleBone:

1 - Install the lastest debian image [from here]
(https://beagleboard.org/latest-images). 

2 - The HDMI port causes interference on the functioning of the USB port and some Encoders GPIO's. To disable it, remove the # in front of the cape_disable command on the /boot/uEnv.txt so it looks like: 

    ##Disable HDMI
    cape_disable=capemgr.disable_partno=BB-BONELT-HDMI,BB-BONELT-HDMIN

3 - Use git clone to download the ProBot's files.
	
	git clone https://github.com/VitorHugoAguiar/ProBot.git

	cd ProBot/ProBot_BeagleBone
