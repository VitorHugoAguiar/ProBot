1 - To control the ProBot with a Webpage, run:

Do not forget to change the ip to the server ip on the WebServer.py file.

    python ProBot_Server/WebPage/WebServer.py 


2 - If we want to control the ProBot with some Midi device, like a joystick, just run instead:

    python ProBot_Server/Midi_Device/forward_ZMQ_Server.py
